|====================

== Introduction

This document is a specification of the EPICS Channel Access (CA) protocol.
Structure of messages exchanged between communicating nodes is defined, as well as semantics of the exchange.
The documentation is focused on version 4.11 of the CA protocol, which comes with EPICS 3.14, and later versions. 

=== Implementation Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in link:http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt[RFC 2119:
Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels]<<references,[3]>>.

An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more of the
MUST or REQUIRED level requirements for the protocols it implements.
An implementation that satisfies all the MUST or REQUIRED level and all the
SHOULD level requirements for its protocols is said to be "unconditionally
compliant"; one that satisfies all the MUST level requirements but not all the
SHOULD level requirements for its protocols is said to be "conditionally
compliant."

This document is based on the original CA protocol implementation that
accompanies EPICS. Wherever the MAY, OPTIONAL or RECOMMENDED is specified, it
implies that experience has shown such behaviour to improve either
performance, portability or memory consumption.

A protocol implementation that is not unconditionally compliant MUST NOT be
used in any production environment or used with EPICS databases controlling
physical devices.


=== Basic Concepts


==== Process Variables

A Process Variable (PV) is representation of a single value within an EPICS
host.


==== Channels

A channel is created whenever a PV is connected using CA.

From implementation point of view, a channel is a connection, established over
virtual circuit, between server and client through which a single PV is
accessed. Both the client and the server will provide a way of uniquely
identifying channels. These identifiers are explained in section
<<message-identifiers,Message Identifiers>>.


==== Monitors

A monitor is created on a channel as a means of registering for asynchronous
change notifications. CA protocol defines the subscription mechanism through
which clients register for notifications. These changes will then be provided
through monitor object or callback, depending on implementation and
environment. Monitors may be filtered to receive only a subset of events,
such as value or alarm changes. Several different monitors may be created for
each channel.


==== Channel Access Client Library

A client library implements channel access protocol and exposes it through a
programmer-friendly API. How the protocol and its mechanisms are implemented
in the library depends on the programming language and no specific
requirements are made with respect to this.


==== Repeater

Repeater is a standalone process that allows several clients on one machine to
share a predefined UDP port for recieving broadcast messages. Broadcast
messages are sent without prior knowledge of which port the CA clients and
hosts are listening at, so predefined port numbers are used. Since most
network stack implementations do not allow multiple clients to listen on the
same port, repeater is installed to listen on a single port, used for
broadcast notifications. Repeater will fan-out unmodified incoming datagram
messages to all the clients on the same host, that have previously registered
with the repeater.

Typically, a client library will attempt to register with the repeater during
startup. If repeater cannot be found or is not available, the library will
attempt to spawn a new repeater process. Repeater and client communicate using
a minimal set of messages over UDP.


==== Server Beacons

Server beacons are simple protocol messages that allow servers to broadcast
their availability. These messages are sent out periodically to announce their
presence. Additionally, these beacons are used to restore virtual circuits
that have lost connections.


==== Virtual Circuit

Channel Access protocol is designed to minimize resources used on both client
and server. Virtual circuits minimize number of TCP connections used between
clients and servers. Each client will have exactly one active and open TCP
connection to an individual server, regardless of how many channels it
accesses over it. This helps to ensure that servers do not get overwhelmed by
too many connections.

The life-cycle of a virtual circuit is defined in section
<<virtual-circuit-operation,Virtual Circuit Operation>>.


==== Message Buffering

When sending packets over network, channel access allows huge savings to be
made by grouping individual messages in a single TCP packet. This is performed
by maintaining per virtual circuit buffers that collect all outgoing messages.
These buffers are flushed upon application's explicit request. This mechanism
is independent of the TCP/IP stack, which maintains its own send queue and
defines a maximum frame size. Messages sent over virtual circuit may be larger
than this and will not always be aligned on frame boundary. Implementation
should also be aware that messages received may not yet be available entirely
or will be split over several TCP frames.


==== Version compatibility

Certain aspects of Channel Access protocol have changed between releases.
In this document, Channel Access versions are identified using `CA_VXYY`,
where X represents single-digit major version number and YY represents a
single- or double-digit minor version number. Stating that a feature is
available in `CA_VXYY` implies that any client supporting version XYY must
support the feature. Implementation must be backward compatible with all
versions up to and including its declared supported minor version number.

.Channel Access version number
====================
`CA_V43`, denotes version 4.3 (major version 4, minor version 3).
====================

Currently, all protocol definitions are assumed to have major version 4.
Minor version ranges from 1 through 11.


==== Exceptions

This document uses the concept of exceptions to refer to the mechanism of
reporting errors that occur during command request execution. An exception
defines reporting of error condition on the server. This can occur either due
to client problem or due to some unexpected condition on the server (such as
running out of resources). Exceptions are reported either within the command's
response or using a specialized message. Actual form and method (response or
asynchronously received message) depends on circumstances where the exception
occurs. Individual commands and messages determine which method is used.


=== Overall Operation

This section is intended as a quick overview of channel access functionality
and behaviour. For more information, please refer to
link:http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/base/R3-14/5-docs/CAref.html[Channel Access
Reference Manual]<<references,[1]>>.

The goal of channel access (CA) is to provide remote access to records and
fields managed by <<glossary,IOC>>, including search and discovery of hosts
and minimal flow contol. Protocol itself is designed to provide minimal
overhead and maximize network throughput for transfer of large number of small
data packets. Additionaly, implementation overhead of the protocol can be kept
very small, to allow operation with limited resources.

All commands and events in CA are encapsulated in predefined messages, which
can be sent in one of three forms:

* As a *beacon*, which requires no confirmation. Used for host discovery and
  keep-alive notification.
* As a *request/response pair*. Most commands use this method.
* As a *subscriber notification*, where the client registers with the host and
  receives updates. Event notification uses this method to report value
  changes.

Communication between server and client is performed by sending command
messages over UDP and TCP. Client will use UDP to search for hosts and PVs,
server will use them to notify its startup and shutdown. Once client requests
a specific <<glossary,PV>> (by specifying its name), UDP message will be
broadcast to either a subnet or a list of predefined addresses, and the server
which hosts requested PV will respond.

Data exchange between client and server is performed over TCP. After locating
the PV, the client will establish a TCP connection to the server. If more that
one PV is found to be on the same server, client will use existing TCP
connection. Reusable TCP connection between client and server is called
<<glossary,Virtual circuit>>.

Once a virtual circuit is established or already available, channels can be
created to PVs.

Let's assume the following setup of PVs and hosts:

* PV "A" is located on host IOC1.
* PV "B" is located on host IOC2.
* PV "C" does not exist on either host.
* PV "D" is located both hosts, IOC1 and IOC2.

A typical scenario would be similar to this:

. User application starts and initializes channel access client library.
  During initialization, client library might spawn a new repeater process or
  register with an existing one. If successful, the library is ready to start
  using the channel access.
. Application will start searching for PVs named "A", "B", "C" and "D".
  Client will send UDP search packets with "A", "B", "C" and "D" PV names,
  and wait for an application-specified amount of time.
  To which network hosts (broadcast or specific IP) these packets are actually
  sent depends on configuration of the client.
. All hosts that receive this message will check their database and if they
  know about any of these PV names, they will respond using UDP search
  response message. Thus, IOC1 will respond with "A" and "D", whereas IOC2
  will respond with "B" and "D".
. For each search packet sent, the client will wait for a predefined amount of
  time or until response is received.
. In this case (assuming no packet loss in the network), the client will
  establish a virtual circuit (TCP connection) to IOC1 and IOC2. PV "C" will
  be assumed to be unavailable at this point and will be ignored.
  Since "D" is located on both hosts, client will be unable to distinguish
  between them. First response received will be considered to be proper answer
  and any additional responses will be considered erroneous and reported to
  user.
. Once virtual circuits are established, client can access values of "A", "B"
  and "D". From now on, all messages for either of the PVs will be sent via a
  corresponding virtual circuit.
. If virtual circuit looses TCP connection or the host disconnects, client
  will notify application appropriately. Client will also listen for server
  beacon messages (sent whenever IOC host starts), to be able to restore any
  lost connections. Beacons are also used to detect when a host stops
  responding.
. Once the application is done using the channel access library, it will
  gracefully close any open connections.


== Data Types

This section defines all primitive data types employed by the CA, as well as
their C/C++ equivalents. These data types are referred to in the subsequent
sections.

[options="header"]
|====================
|Type Name|C/C++|Description
|`BYTE`|`char`|Signed 8-bit integer.
|`UBYTE`|`unsigned char`|Unsigned 8-bit integer.
|`INT16`|`short`|Signed 16-bit integer.
|`UINT16`|`unsigned short`|Unsigned 16-bit integer.
|`INT32`|`int`|Signed 32-bit integer.
|`UINT32`|`unsigned int`|Unsigned 32-bit integer.
|`FLOAT`|`float`|IEEE 32-bit float.
|`DOUBLE`|`double`|IEEE 64-bit float.
|`STRING[n]`|`char[]`|Array of `UBYTE`s. If `[n]` is specified, it indicates maximum allowed number of characters in this string including (if neccessary) termination character.
|`TIMESTAMP`|None|Timestamp represented with two `UINT32` values. First is number of seconds since 0000 Jan 1, 1990. Second is number of nanoseconds within second
|====================

All values are transmitted over the network in big-endian (network) order.
For example: `UINT32` 3145 (`0x00000C49`) would be sent over the network
represented as `00 00 0C 49`.


== Messages


=== Message Structure

All channel access messages are composed of a *header*, followed by the
*payload*.

Header is always present. Its structure is fixed, and contains predefined
fields. At the very least, this will be command ID and payload size.
Other header fields may carry command-specific meaning. If a field is not used
within a certain message, its value must be 0 (`0x00`).

Payload is a sequence of bytes, which are command and version dependent.
Implementation is required to provide proper payload with respect to
individual command specification.

Total size of an individual message is limited. With CA versions older than
`CA_V49`, the maximum message size is limited to 16384 (`0x4000`) bytes.
Out of these, header has a fixed size of 16 (`0x10`) bytes, with the payload
having a maximum size of 16368 (`0x3ff0`) bytes.

Versions `CA_V49` and higher may use the *extended message form*, which allows
for larger payloads. The extended message form is indicated by the header
fields `Payload Size` and `Data Count` being set to `0xffff` and 0,
respectively. Real payload size and data count are then given as `UINT32` type
values immediately following the header. Maximum message size is limited by
32-bit unsigned integer representation, 4294967295 (`0xffffffff`).
Maximum payload size is limited to 4294967255 (`0xffffffe7`).

Extended message form should only be used if payload size actualy exceeds the
pre-`CA_V49` message size limit of 16368 bytes.


==== Header

.Standard Message Header
[options="header"]
|====================
|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7
2+|Command 2+|Payload size 2+|Data type 2+|Data count
4+|Parameter 1 4+|Parameter 2
|====================

.Extended Message Header
[options="header"]
|====================
|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7
2+|Command 2+|`0xFFFF` 2+|Data type 2+|`0x0000`
4+|Parameter 1 4+|Parameter 2
4+|Payload size 4+|Data count
|====================

Names of header fields are based on their most common use. Certain messages
will use individual fields for purposes other than those described here. These
variations are documented for each message individually. All of values in
header are unsigned integers.

The common header present in all messages is structured as follows:

[options="header"]
|====================
|Parameter|Type|Description
|Command|`UINT16`|Identifier of the command this message requests. The meaning of other header fields and the payload depends on the command.
|Payload Size|`UINT16`|Size of the payload (in bytes). Must not exceed `0x4000`. Value of `0xFFFF` indicates extended message.
|Data Type|`UINT16`|Identifier of the data type carried in the payload. Data types are defined in section <<payload-data-types,Payload Data Types>>.
|Data Count|`UINT16`|Number of elements in the payload.
|Parameter 1|`UINT32`|Command dependent parameter.
|Parameter 2|`UINT32`|Command dependent parameter.
|====================

The extended message header (`CA_V49` and newer) has the following structure:

[options="header"]
|====================
|Parameter|Type|Description
|Command|`UINT16`|Identifier of the command this message requests. The meaning of other header fields and the payload depends on the command.
|`0xFFFF`|`UINT16`|Extended message marker.
|Data Type|`UINT16`|Identifier of the data type carried in the payload. Data types are defined in section <<payload-data-types,Payload Data Types>>.
|`0x0000`|`UINT16`|Extended message marker.
|Parameter 1|`UINT32`|Command dependent parameter.
|Parameter 2|`UINT32`|Command dependent parameter.
|Payload Size|`UINT32`|Size of the payload (in bytes).
|Data Count|`UINT32`|Number of elements in the payload.
|====================


==== Payload

The structure of the payload depends on the type of the message. The size of
the payload matches the `Payload Size` header field.

[NOTE]
If the payload size is not a multiple of 8, zero-padding must be performed to
achieve 8-byte alignment.


=== Message Identifiers

Some fields in messages serve as identifiers, which must be properly handled
by the implementation. These fields serve as identification tokens in
asynchronous communication and must be unique within the context of the client
library. Recommended scheme for allocating these values is to create them
sequentially starting at 0. All IDs are represented with `UINT32`.

Overflow must be anticipated! Although it is unlikely that an application will
need more than 2^32^ different channel IDs, such an overflow can occur with
the IOID identifier (see below).


[[cid-client-id]]
==== CID - Client ID

CID identifies individual channel within client library context. When a
message requires the CID, this value must be passed. CID for a given channel
may not change within the lifetime of the channel.

Recommended way of allocating CIDs is sequential 0-based indexing.
First client library channel reference that is created has value of 0,
second 1, etc. Duplicate CIDs within a single active instance of client
library are not allowed.

CID value is passed to the server when the channel is actually connected.

Overflow should be potentially handled, since an application with expected
long lifetime and frequent channel allocation and destruction might increase
the index frequently. The best way to handle it is to ignore the problem until
the first overflow. When that occurs, old CIDs should be no longer relevant,
and CID value can be restarted from 0, but excluding any already used values.


[[sid-server-id]]
==== SID - Server ID

Performs the same function as CID, but is provided by the server when the
channel is connected. SID of channel will never change, unless the channel
represented by particular SID is removed from the server during runtime.
In that case, the channel will be no longer available.

To handle overflows, the same method could be used as for the Client Channel
ID.


[[subscription-id]]
==== Subscription ID

When a subscription is created on a channel (monitor), a unique subscription
ID must be provided. Client library will use this ID to identify different
subscriptions on the same channel. This value will allow the client library to
dispatch monitors appropriately.

Any subscription ID is only valid during the subscription's lifespan. After
that, IDs may be reused.


==== IOID

Unique ID is given to all read and write messages sent by the client library.

ID passed with the request will be returned in the matching response.

Properly handling the wrapping of identifiers is vital to IOID, since an
individual ID is used each time a request is made.


== Commands (TCP and UDP)

The following commands are sent as either UDP datagrams or TCP messages.
Some of the messages are also used within the context of a Virtual Circuit.


[[ca-proto-version]]
=== `CA_PROTO_VERSION`

[horizontal]
Command::
    `CA_PROTO_VERSION`
ID::
    0 (`0x00`)
Description::
    Exchanges client and server protocol versions and desired circuit
    priority. This is the first message sent when a new TCP (Virtual Circuit)
    connection is established. Must be sent before any other exchange between
    client, server and repeater. The communication is not strictly request
    response, but will be perceived as such by the implementation.
    When a new TCP connection is established by the client, `CA_PROTO_VERSION`
    is sent. Likewise, the server will accept the connection and send the
    response form back. Sent over UDP or TCP.


==== Request

.Header
[options="header"]
|====================
|Field|Value|Description
|Command|0|Command identifier for `CA_PROTO_VERSION`.
|Payload size|0|Must be 0.
|Priority|Desired priority|Virtual circuit priority.
|Version|Version number|Minor protocol version number. Only used when sent over TCP.

|Reserved|0|Must be 0.
|====================

.Compatibility
[options="header"]
|====================
|Version|Comment
|>= `CA_V411`|Server will send response immediately after establishing a virtual circuit.
|< `CA_V411`|Message does not include minor version number (it is always 0) and is interpreted as an echo command that carries no data. Version exchange is performed immediately after <<ca-proto-create-chan,`CA_PROTO_CREATE_CHAN`>>.
|====================

.Comments
* Priority indicates the server's dispatch scheduling priority which might be
  implemented by a circuit dedicated thread's scheduling priority in a
  preemptive scheduled OS.


==== Response

.Header

|====================
|Field|Value|Description
|Command|0|Command identifier for `CA_PROTO_VERSION`.
|Reserved|0|Must be 0.
|Priority|0|Must be 0.
|Version|Version number|Minor protocol version number. Only used when sent over TCP.
|Reserved|0|Must be 0.
|Reserved|0|Must be 0.
|====================

.Compatibility
[options="header"]
|====================
|Version|Comment
|>= `CA_V411`|Server will not respond to request, but send response immediately after establishing a virtual circuit.
|< `CA_V411`|Message does not include minor version number (it is always 0).
|====================


[[ca-proto-search]]
=== `CA_PROTO_SEARCH`

[horizontal]
Command::
    `CA_PROTO_SEARCH`
ID::
    6 (`0x06`)
Description::
    Searches for a given channel name. Sent over UDP or TCP.


==== Request

.Header
[options="header"]
|====================
|Field|Value|Description
|Command|6|Command identifier for `CA_PROTO_SEARCH`.
|Payload Size|>= 0|Padded size of channel name.
|Reply|Reply Flag|<<search-reply-flag,Search Reply Flag>>, indicating whether failed search response should be returned.
|Version|Version Number|Client minor protocol version number.
|CID|Channel CID|Client allocated CID.
|CID|Channel CID|Client allocated CID.
|====================

.Payload
[options="header"]
|====================
|Name|Type|Value|Description
|Channel name|`STRING`||Name of channel to search for.
|====================

.Comments
* Sent as a UDP datagram.
* It is illegal to specify `DO_REPLY` flag whenever the message is sending as
  UDP datagram, regardless of whether broadcast or multicast is used.
* CID will be allocated by the client before this message is sent.
* CID field value is duplicated.
* Reply flag will be generally `DONT_REPLY` when searching using broadcast and
  `DO_REPLY` when searching using unicast. When `DO_REPLY` is set, server will
  send a <<ca-proto-not-found,`CA_PROTO_NOT_FOUND`>> message indicating it
  does not have the requested channel.


==== Response

.Header
[options="header"]
|====================
|Field|Value|Description
|Command|6|Command identifier for `CA_PROTO_SEARCH`.
|Payload Size|8|Payload size is constant.
|Data Type|Port number|TCP Port number of server that responded.
|Data Count|0|Must be 0.
|SID|`0xffffffff`|Temporary <<sid-server-id,SID>>.
|CID|Same as request|Channel <<cid-client-id,CID>>.
|====================

.Payload
[options="header"]
|====================
|Name|Type|Value|Description
|Server protocol version|`UINT16`||Server protocol version.
|====================

.Comments
* Received as UDP datagram.
* Client channel ID field value (CID) is copied from the request.
* Port number of the server indicates on which port the server that replied
  listens to. This is used in case more than one server share the same IP.
* Server-assigned channel ID will have value of `0xffffffff`, since the SID is
  not known at this time. Real value will be returned when channel is actually
  created using `CA_CREATE_CHAN`.
* In `CA_V411` the server's IP address is optionally returned in the CID field
  of the header allowing a CA server to act as a directory service.
  If not, then the CID field is set to `0xffffffff`.
* The port number included in the header is the *TCP* port of the server.
  Two servers on the same host can share a UDP port number, but not a TCP port
  number. Therefore, the port the client needs to connect to in that situation
  may not be the same as expected if this field in the response is not used.


[[ca-proto-not-found]]
=== `CA_PROTO_NOT_FOUND`

[horizontal]
Command::
    `CA_PROTO_NOT_FOUND`
ID::
    14 (`0x0E`)
Description::
    Indicates that a channel with requested name does not exist.
    Sent in response to <<ca-proto-search,`CA_PROTO_SEARCH`>>, but only when
    its `DO_REPLY` flag was set. Sent over UDP.


==== Response

.Header
[options="header"]
|====================
|Field|Value|Description
|Command|14|Command identifier for `CA_PROTO_NOT_FOUND`.
|Reserved|0|Must be 0.
|Reply Flag|`DO_REPLY`|Same reply flag as in request: always `DO_REPLY`.
|Version|Same as request|Client minor protocol version number.
|CID|Same as request|CID of the channel.
|CID|Same as request|CID of the channel.
|====================

.Comments
* Contents of the header are copied from the request.
* CID fields are diplicated.
* Original request payload is not returned with the response.


[[ca-proto-echo]]
=== `CA_PROTO_ECHO`

[horizontal]
Command::
    `CA_PROTO_ECHO`
ID::
    23 (`0x17`)
Description::
    Connection verify used by `CA_V43`. Sent over TCP.

== Commands (UDP)

The following commands are sent as UDP datagrams.


[[ca-proto-rsrv-is-up]]
=== `CA_PROTO_RSRV_IS_UP`

[horizontal]
Command::
    `CA_PROTO_RSRV_IS_UP`
ID::
    13 (`0x0D`)
Description::
    Beacon sent by a server when it becomes available. Beacons are also sent
    out periodically to announce the server is still alive. Another function
    of beacons is to allow detection of changes in network topology.
    Sent over UDP.


==== Response

.Header
[options="header"]
|====================
|Field|Value|Description
|Command|13|Command identifier for `CA_PROTO_RSRV_IS_UP`.
|Reserved|0|Must be 0.
|Server port|>= 0|TCP Port the server is listening on.
|Reserved|0|Must be 0.
|BeaconID|Sequential integers|Sequential Beacon ID.
|Address|0 or IP|May contain IP address of the server.
|====================

.Comments
* IP field may contain IP of the server. If IP is not present (field Address
  value is 0), then IP may be substituted by the receiver of the packet
  (usually repeater) if it is capable of identifying where this packet came
  from. Any non-zero address must be interpreted as server's IP address.
* BeaconIDs are useful in detecting network topology changes. In certain
  cases, same packet may be routed using two different routes, causing
  problems with datagrams. If multiple beacons are received from the same
  server with same BeaconID, multiple routes are the cause.
* If a server is restarted, it will most likely start sending BeaconID values
  from beggining (0). Such situation must be anticipated.


[[ca-repeater-confirm]]
=== `CA_REPEATER_CONFIRM`

[horizontal]
Command::
    `CA_REPEATER_CONFIRM`
ID::
    17 (`0x11`)
Description::
    Confirms successful client registration with repeater. Sent over UDP.


==== Response

.Header
[options="header"]
|====================
|Field|Value|Description
|Command|17|Command identifier for `CA_REPEATER_CONFIRM`.
|Reserved|0|Must be 0.
|Reserved|0|Must be 0.
|Reserved|0|Must be 0.
|Reserved|0|Must be 0.
|Repeater address|IP address|Address with which the registration succeeded.
|====================

.Comments
* Since repeater can bind to different local address, its IP is reported in

[[payload-data-types]]
== Payload Data Types

Channel access defines special structures to transferring data. Main reason is
efficiency, since in many cases more than one value can be transferred. These
types are organized in typed hierarchies with loose inheritance. There are
seven basic data types: `DBR_STRING`, `DBR_SHORT`, `DBR_INT`, `DBR_FLOAT`,
`DBR_ENUM`, `DBR_CHAR`, `DBR_LONG` and `DBR_DOUBLE`. Each of these types can
be represented as an array, if the corresponding field in header indicates
that.

Additional to basic data types, structured types allow access to more than one
value within the same record. These structures are status (STS), time stamp
(TIME), graphic (GR) and control (CTRL). All these structures contain value as
the last field.

Status structure adds alarm severity. Time stamp structures extends the status
structure by adding time stamp of the value. Graphic extends status structure
by providing alarm limits, units and precision. Control structure extends
graphic by adding control limits.

Following is the list of all structures as transmitted over network.

== Constants


=== Port numbers

Although there is no requirement as to which port numbers are used by either
servers or clients, there are some standard values which must be used as
defaults, unless overriden by application.

Port numbers are dependant on protocol versions and are calculated using the
folowing definitions:

`CA_PORT_BASE` = 5056

`CA_SERVER_PORT` = `CA_PORT_BASE` + `MAJOR_PROTOCOL_VERSION` * 2

`CA_REPEATER_PORT` = `CA_PORT_BASE` + `MAJOR_PROTOCOL_VERSION` * 2 + 1

Based on protocol version described in this document (4.11), port numbers used
are `CA_SERVER_PORT` = 5064 and `CA_REPEATER_PORT` = 5065.

Since registration of port numbers with link:https://iana.org[IANA] and in the
interest of compatibility, the version numbers are unlikely to change.
Therefore, the port numbers described here (5064 and 5065) may be considered
final.


=== Representation of constants

This section lists various constants, their types and values used by protocol.

Some constants can be combined using logical OR operation. Example: Monitor
mask of `DBE_VALUE` and `DBE_ALARM` are combined using `(DBE_VALUE or
DBE_ALARM)` resulting in `(1 or 4 == 5)`.

To query the whether certain value is present in such combined value, and
operation is used. Example: to query whether `DBE_ALARM` of monitor mask is
set, `(DBE_VALUE and MASK > 0)` will return 0 if `DBE_VALUE` is not present,
otherwise `DBE_ALARM` is present.


[[monitor-mask]]
=== Monitor Mask

Indicates which changes to the value should be reported back to client
library. Different values can be combined using logical OR operation.

*Type:* not defined, depends on the field it is in (usually `UINT16`)

* `DBE_VALUE` - value 1 (`0x01`) - Value change events are reported. Value
  changes take into consideration a dead band within which the value changes
  are not reported.
* `DBE_LOG` - value 2 (`0x02`) - Log events are reported. Similiar to
  `DBR_VALUE`, `DBE_LOG` defines a different dead band value that determines
  frequency of updates.
* `DBE_ALARM` - value 4 (`0x04`) - Alarm events are reported whenever alarm
  value of the channel changes.


[[search-reply-flag]]
=== Search Reply Flag

Indicates whether server should reply to failed search messages. If a server
does not know about channel name, it has the option of replying to request or
ignoring it. Usually, servers contacted through address list will receive
request for reply.

*Type:* not defined, depends on the field it is in (usually `UINT16`).

* `DO_REPLY` - value 10 (`0x0a`) - Server should reply to failed search
  requests.
* `DONT_REPLY` - value 5 (`0x05`) - Server should ignore failed requests.


[[access-rights]]
=== Access Rights

Defines access rights for a given channel. Accss rights are defined as
logicaly ORred value of allowed access.

*Type:* not defined, depends on the field it is in (usually `UINT16`).

* `CA_PROTO_ACCESS_RIGHT_READ` - value 1 (`0x01`) - Read access is allowed
* `CA_PROTO_ACCESS_RIGHT_WRITE` - value 2 (`0x02`) - Write access is allowed.

As a reference, the following values are valid.

* 0 - No access
* 1 - Read access only
* 2 - Write access only
* 3 - Read and write access


== Example message

This example shows construction of messages. For details of individual
structures, see message and data type reference (`CA_PROTO_READ_NOTIFY` and
`DBR_GR_INT16`).

A client will send `CA_PROTO_READ_NOTIFY` message with the following contents.

* Data type: `DBR_GR_INT16`
* Element count: 5
* Server ID: 22 (obtained during channel creation)
* Sequence ID: 56 (each read or write request increases value by one)

The messsage would be represented as follows:

----
00 0F (command) 00 00 (payload size) 00 16 (data type) 00 05 (element count)
00 00 00 16 (server ID) 00 00 00 38 (sequence ID)
----

Server would respond with success and return requested value with individual
`DBR_GR_INT16` fields having the following values.

* Status: `ECA_NORMAL`
* Severity: `NO_ALARM` (0)

----
00 0f (command) 00 20 (payload size) 00 16 (data type) 00 05 (element count)
00 00 00 16 (server ID) 00 00 00 38 (sequence ID)
00 05  00 02  43 6f 75 6e 74 73 00 00  00 0a  00 00
00 08  00 06  00 04  00 02  00 00  00 00  00 00 00 00
    8      6      4      2      0      0      0     0

[[virtual-circuit-operation]]
== Virtual Circuit Operation

image:virtual-circuit.png[Virtual Circuit Schematic]


=== Establishing virtual circuit

Virtual circuit is a TCP connection between a client and a server. Each
virtual circuit has an associated priority, which can be used by server to
prioritize requests depending on current load. An independent circuit for
each priority level selected by the client might be used because it allows
for preemptive prioritized dispatch scheduling in the server when the OS
supports that, and also allows specifying the networks scheduling priority
when the router and or LAN support that. Regardless of how many channels are
handled by either client or server, each client-server pair will be connected
with exactly one TCP connection for each priority level. This level is
specified when creating a virtual circuit.

When establishing a virtual circuit, a simple handshake will be performed.
Client will open a TCP connection to the server. After that, it sends
<<ca-proto-version,`CA_PROTO_VERSION`>>,
<<ca-proto-client-name,`CA_PROTO_CLIENT_NAME`>> and
<<ca-proto-host-name,`CA_PROTO_HOST_NAME`>> messages.
If server accepts all the supplied parameters and the client and host are
permitted to connect, the server will respond with
<<ca-proto-version,`CA_PROTO_VERSION`>>.
After that, client may start sending requests.

Virtual circuit will remain active as long as there is at least one channel
active. If the TCP connection is lost, all channels using this circuit must be
notified.


=== Basic mode of operation

In most basic role, the client will send requests to the server and await one
or more responses, or in some special cases, no response will be expected.
For each type of request, one of three events will occur:

* Matching response will be received
* Error response will be received by client indicating either user or client error
* The client will receive no response, and one was expected.
* Network failure occurs

When a matching response is received, the operation has completed
successfully. Any result returned will report any applicable return
information. Client library will then notify the client about completion.

If a request fails and server could handle this failure,
<<ca-proto-error,`CA_PROTO_ERROR`>> response will be received or error code is
received in response, depending on the request sent. This response contains
original request header, error code and text description of error.

Although servers are designed to always return a response, in some cases this
will not occur. An unlikely case is that a server has failed or stopped
responding. A more common case is broadcast search, where no replies are sent
to search messages. The later case is designed to not overload the network by
sending failure notifications. This however does not allow client library to
determine, whether a search has failed, or the server load is simply too high
and the response will arrive later. In this case, client library may assume
that search yielded no results and notify on search failure. Regardless of
this, should any such response arrive late, the client must be notified.

In case of network failure, two situations should be anticipated. One is TCP
connection loss for a virtual circuit. Virtual circuit has mechanisms for
dealing with such case and should attempt to restore the connection itself.
Repeater has no such mechanisms, since it depends on reliability of UDP
protocol. There will be in most cases no way for repeater to determine,
whether the packets sent actually arrive at destination. Repeater can however
verify the clients registered with it, by attempting to bind to their port.
If binding succeeds, the client no longer exists. Alternate way is using
connected UDP sockets and checking ICMP destination unreachable error.


=== Detecting virtual circuit unresponsiveness

During virtual circuit life-time, the circuit may become unresponsive.
Since this is tightly related to network availability and server load,
determining actual cause for unresponsiveness is difficult. Basic criteria on
which unresponsiveness should be determined are:

* No beacon received from server in expected time period
* No response received from server for a predetermined ammount of time
  (usually 30 seconds)
* Server does not immediatelly respond to <<ca-proto-echo,`CA_PROTO_ECHO`>>

Behaviour of virtual circuit implementation under such conditions is
undefined. Experience has shown however, that virtual circuit should not be
disconnected when it becomes unresponsive, since this negatively impacts
network performance under load.


=== Channel life-cycle

image:connection-states.png[Connection States]

A channel discussed here is based on two levels. One is channel as seen from
client application, the other is channel implementation in client library.
This difference will be pointed out where applicable.

When a channel is created by client application, it is initialized in
_NEVER_CONN_ state. This indicates that channel is currently being connected
for the first time. If connection process fails, channel moves into _FAILED_
state and is not usable. Connection proccess within the client library will
attempt to connect the channel repeatedly. Intervals between consecutive
attempts should be increased, before finally giving up and determining the
channel cannot be connected and signaling _FAILED_ state. A total number of
attempts can be on the order of 100.

When connection is established, the channel will signal to client with
_CONN_UP_ event and changing its state to connected.

Should the virtual circuit connection be lost, _CONN_DOWN_ event will change
channel state to disconnected. Whenever virtual circuit is reconnected, the
channel state is restored to connected. Note that reconnection process follows
the same rules as initial process. It is also possible, that the PV will move
between the servers, but client application should not be aware of such
internal changes to channel.

Once client application is done using the channel, it will be closed and its
state moved changed to _CLOSED_. After that, this channel can no longer be
used.

Detailed description of channel operations is outlined below.


=== Connecting a Channel

Connection of a channel is a two phase process. First, server that hosts
channel with a given name must be located. Second, client and server must both
register a connection.

Before connection, client library allocates CID identifier that will be used
to reference new channel. Next it sends <<ca-proto-search,`CA_PROTO_SEARCH`>>
with channel name request via broadcast and/or to address list. Each server
that receives such message checks to see if it knows about this name. If it
does, response to <<ca-proto-search,`CA_PROTO_SEARCH`>> is sent back to
client. If not, the server checks if reply field of request is `DO_REPLY` and
responds with <<ca-proto-not-found,`CA_PROTO_NOT_FOUND`>>, otherwise does
nothing.

Client library may receive more than one response. In this case, first
response should be used and others rejected. The cause of multiple responses
is same PV hosted on multiple different hosts. Client or server has no method
of knowing which PV is 'right'. Multiple responses should be reported by the
client to the application or user.

After extracting server address and port, client library checks to see if this
server is already known and connected via virtual circuit. If not, virtual
circuit is established. Any requests sent through this channel will use this
circuit.

For this it sends <<ca-proto-create-chan,`CA_PROTO_CREATE_CHAN`>> request with
channels CID and channel name. Server will respond with
<<ca-proto-create-chan,`CA_PROTO_CREATE_CHAN`>> response which will provide
channel type, data count and server identifier SID. In case the channel could
not be created, error message will be returned.

Having initialized both CID and SID and registered the channel with the
server, this channel is ready for use. Client library should store these
values for further use.


=== Read and Write operations

Read and write operations require the channel to be properly initialized and
connected and its virtual circuit to be active. These operations use
<<ca-proto-read-notify,`CA_PROTO_READ_NOTIFY`>> and
<<ca-proto-write-notify,`CA_PROTO_WRITE_NOTIFY`>> messages.

To read a value from a channel client library will create a
<<ca-proto-read-notify,`CA_PROTO_READ_NOTIFY`>> request. This request will
contain desired data type and data count parameters which may differ from
channels native type as obtained during connect. Additionally, IOID is stored
in request to provide unique identification. Channel that is used will be
identified by SID that was obtained during channel creation. No payload is
sent with request.

After server processes the message reponse is either valid
<<ca-proto-read-notify,`CA_PROTO_READ_NOTIFY`>> response or
<<ca-proto-error,`CA_PROTO_ERROR`>> to indicate error. In case of success,
response contains same field values as request, but has additional payload.
This payload is formatted as requested data type with desired number of
elements.

Write operation is performed identically with payload roles reversed. Here the
request will contain payload with DBR formatted value to write and response
will have no payload.


=== Subscriptions and Monitors

Client creates monitors by registering a subscription on a channel. This
causes server to notify subscribers of value changes.

Subscriptions are created by first allocating unique Subscription ID. This
identifier is used to uniquely identify various subscriptions. Next,
<<ca-proto-event-add,`CA_PROTO_EVENT_ADD`>> request is created using SID and
Subscription ID. Data type and data count indicate desired value format in
response. Additional information is provided in payload as specified in
<<ca-proto-event-add,`CA_PROTO_EVENT_ADD`>> reference.

First <<ca-proto-event-add,`CA_PROTO_EVENT_ADD`>> response is received
immediately to confirm successful subscription. If error occurs,
<<ca-proto-error,`CA_PROTO_ERROR`>> response is received.

Responses arrive asynchronously until client cancels the subscription using
<<ca-proto-event-add,`CA_PROTO_EVENT_ADD`>> response and payload containing
DBR formatted value. If server is shutdown during this time, events will no
longer arrive, but the subscription will not be cancelled. Once the server is
restarted, client library will reestablish the subscription silently without
notifying client application.

Subscription is cancelled by sending
<<ca-proto-event-cancel,`CA_PROTO_EVENT_CANCEL`>> request with relevant
parameters identical to those in original
<<ca-proto-event-add,`CA_PROTO_EVENT_ADD`>> request that created the
subscription. Successful cancelation is confirmed by
<<ca-proto-event-add,`CA_PROTO_EVENT_ADD`>> response without payload.

Cancelling the subscription while the server is down should be handled by
cancelling the subscription locally and not reestablishing it once the server
is up again.


=== Connection events

If a virtual circuit is disconnected (server goes down or stops sending
beacons), any connected channels that use this circuit should be notified.
There is no direct way to reconnect the channel from client side, but this
will be done by the library. Once the circuit is reestablished, client
application is notified of status change for all channels. Even if a channel
is reported to be disconnect as a result of virtual circuit failure, the
channel is not closed. The only way a channel connection is actually closed
is by explicitly closing it using
<<ca-proto-clear-channel,`CA_PROTO_CLEAR_CHANNEL`>> thereby invalidating its
resources.


=== Closing the channel

Channel is closed by sending
<<ca-proto-clear-channel,`CA_PROTO_CLEAR_CHANNEL`>> request.
Regardless of whether response confirmes closing or reports an error, CID and
SID associated with the channel are no longer valid. Any resources still
available to the client application are considered invalid. A channel that was
cleared may no longer be reconnected.


== Repeater Operation

image:repeater.png[Repeater Schematic]


=== Role

Simple demonstration of repeater operation. A repeater will be used both on
client and server side to forward incoming UDP requests to multiple clients
and/or server on same host. Each host or client will then respond on its own.

Since role of the repeater is related to host, not the client, its
implementation must be independent from individual client instance or process.
Repeater must not stop operation until all clients depending on it registered
with it have shut down.


=== Startup

Each client must check for presence of repeater on startup, before any access
to EPICS hosts is made. This check is made by attempting to bind to
`CA_REPEATER_PORT`. If binding fails, the client may assume the repeater is
already running and may attempt to register. This is done by sending
`CA_REPEATER_REGISTER` datagram to `CA_REPEATER_PORT`. If repeater is already
active, it will respond with `CA_REPEATER_CONFIRM` datagram back to client,
otherwise the client can assume, the repeater is invalid, the process bound to
the port is not even a repeater or that some unknown error occured. In this
case, client will spawn new repeater and attempt registration again. Attempt
to detect the repeater and register should be made several times with some
reasonable delay to avoid any transient unresponsiveness that might occur.

After the client has received registration confirmation from the repeater, it
should keep listening for messages from the repeater. Any broadcasts sent by
servers will be received by the repeater and forwarded to registered clients.


=== Client detection

The repeater tests to see if its clients exist by periodically attempting to
bind to their ports. If unsuccessful when attempting to bind to the client's
port, then the repeater concludes that the client no longer exists.
A technique using connected UDP sockets and ICMP destination unreachable can
also used. If a client is determined to no longer be present then the repeater
un-registers that client and no longer sends messages to it.


=== Operation

Each message, the repeater receives, must be forwarded to local clients, to 
the address provided during registration. No assumption should be made about 
existence or state of clients.


=== Shutdown

Repeater should not shutdown on its own, if it does, there should be no active 
clients registered with it.


== Server Beacons

Each EPICS server will send beacons periodically to report it is still active. 
Beacon messages will contain server's IP and port, as well as sequential 
beacon ID. Beacons will be broadcast and sent to servers address list.

When a server becomes active, it will immediately start sending beacons with 
an increasing delay. Time between beacons will start at 0.02 seconds. After 
each beacon is sent, this time is doubled. Maximum delay between beacons will 
be limited by server specified parameter, but is commonly 15 seconds.

If a beacon is not received within expexted time, virtual circuits connected 
to this server should be notified and virtual circuit must handle this 
situation.


[[return-codes]]
== Return Codes

This section covers return codes and exceptions that can occur during CA 
command processing. In general, exceptions will be used to report various 
events to the application. Return codes are predefined values for conditions 
that can occur, where as exceptions are actually reported. Apart from 
exceptions that occur on server or due to network transport, additional error 
conditions may be reported on the client side as local exceptions.

Implementation is required to handle all return codes. Local exceptions should 
be thrown whenever implied, but only if such exception is reasonable within 
the scope of implementation. Certain local exceptions that deal with state 
dependent exception must always be provided.

*Naming convention:* All return codes defined within the scope of CA are 
listed with all capitals, with underscore character (`_`) replacing spaces. 
Additionally, all exception names are prefixed with string `ECA_`.

Return codes are represented as `UINT16`. First 3 least signifficant bits 
indicate severity, remaining 13 bits are return code ID.

Return codes are communicated in the protocol by the `CA_PROTO_READ_NOTIFY`, 
`CA_PROTO_WRITE_NOTIFY`, monitor subscription responses, and the 
`CA_PROTO_ERROR` responses.

== Example conversation

This is example conversation between client and server. Client first 
establishes TCP connection to the server and immediately requests creation of 
a channel. After server aknowledges channel creation, client reads the value 
of the channel twice. First as a single string value and second as a 
`DBR_GR_INT16` type. After the response to both queries has been received, 
the channel is destroyed.
