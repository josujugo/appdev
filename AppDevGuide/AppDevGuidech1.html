<!--l. 116--><p class="noindent" >The basic model of what an IOC should do and how to do it was developed by Bob Dalesio at LANL/GTA. The principle ideas
for Channel Access were developed by Jeff Hill at LANL/GTA. Bob and Jeff also were the principle implementers of the
original IOC software. This software (called GTACS) was developed over a period of several years with feedback from
LANL/GTA users. Without their ideas EPICS would not exist.
</p><!--l. 122--><p class="noindent" >During 1990 and 1991, ANL/APS undertook a major revision of the IOC software with the major goal being to provide easily
extendible record and device support. Marty Kraimer (ANL/APS) was primarily responsible for designing the data
structures needed to support extendible record and device support and for making the changes needed to the
IOC resident software. Bob Zieman (ANL/APS) designed and implemented the UNIX build tools and IOC
modules necessary to support the new facilities. Frank Lenkszus (ANL/APS) made extensive changes to the
Database Configuration Tool (DCT) necessary to support the new facilities. Janet Anderson developed methods to
systematically test various features of the IOC software and is the principal implementer of changes to record
support.
</p><!--l. 128--><p class="noindent" >During 1993 and 1994, Matt Needes at LANL implemented and supplied the description of fast database links and the database
debugging tools.
</p><!--l. 130--><p class="noindent" >During 1993 and 1994 Jim Kowalkowski at ANL/APS developed GDCT and also developed the ASCII database instance
format now used as the standard format. At that time he also created the functionality of the <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="pcrr7t-">dbLoadRecords</span></span></span> and
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="pcrr7t-">dbLoadTemplate</span></span></span> commands.
</p><!--l. 133--><p class="noindent" >The <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="pcrr7t-">build</span></span></span> utility method resulted in the generation of binary files of UNIX that were loaded into IOCs. As new IOC
architectures started being supported this caused problems. During 1995, after learning from an abandoned effort now referred
to as <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="pcrr7t-">EpicsRX</span></span></span>, the build utilities and binary file (called <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="pcrr7t-">default.dctsdr</span></span></span>) were replaced by all ASCII files. The new
method provides architecture independence and a more flexible environment for configuring the record types, device and driver
support. This principle implementer was Marty Kraimer with many ideas contributed by John Winans and Jeff Hill. Bob
Dalesio made sure that we did not go too far, i.e. 1) make it difficult to upgrade existing applications and 2) lose
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
performance.
</p><!--l. 140--><p class="noindent" >In early 1996 Bob Dalesio tackled the problem of allowing runtime link modification. This turned into a cooperative
development effort between Bob and Marty Kraimer. The effort included new code for database to Channel Access links, a new
library for lock sets, and a cleaner interface for accessing database links.
</p><!--l. 144--><p class="noindent" >In early 1999 the port of iocCore to non vxWorks operating systems was started. The principle developers were Marty Kraimer,
Jeff Hill, and Janet Anderson. William Lupton converted the sequencer as well as helping with the posix threads
implementation of osiSem and osiThread. Eric Norum provided the port to RTEMS and also contributed the shell that is used
on non vxWorks environments. Ralph Lange provided the port to HPUX.
